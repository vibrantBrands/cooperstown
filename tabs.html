		<h1>Team Info</h1>

		<p>The fields at Cooperstown All Star Village feature the kind of turf and lighting that you&rsquo;ll find in Major League stadiums.</p>

		<p>All tournament games are played on state-of-the-art built fields with major baseball league amenities. Every field is patterned like major league baseball fields complete with warning track, LED lighted score boards, stainless steel drinking fountains, spectator viewing areas with stage seating and professional sports field lighting. Just like the pros.</p>

		<p>There are eleven&nbsp;fields, each with a slightly different character -- including three&nbsp;all turf fields called Yankee Stadium, Chicago Stadium and California Stadium. There are eight natural (dirt and grass) fields and two that challenge players to beat the Green Monster.&nbsp;Souvenir &quot;I Hit One Over the Green Monster&quot; T-shirts are available for purchase in the gift shop.</p>

		<p>All of our fields are equipped with web cams that broadcast the games live on the internet and back to our full service restaurant. Our professional broadcaster booth web casts the&nbsp;<strong>Cooperstown Tournament of Champions</strong>&nbsp;games in real time every Thursday.</p>
